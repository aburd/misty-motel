	<h3 class="subsubtitle">Album Reviews by Tina Gurple and Keul Shoerts</h3>

	<p class="article">Bruce Lee has always impressed us.  Every now and then a friend posts an inspirational quote to our joint married couple Facebook that we take a break from watching Netflix to just LOVE.  (Be like the water, my friend.)  So we decided to marry work and play, and search for an album by Bruce Lee, hoping to find a collection of wit and wisdom worthy of his great mentor and scene luminary, Master Yip.  Instead, we found ‘My Way of Kung Fu,’ an epic, roughly 45-minute journey into the perfunctory and mundane unseen since the dawn of musique concrete or Deloused in the Comatorium.</p>

	<p class="article">Is it indulgent?  Sure. Does it have a right to be? Undoubtedly.  However, one is not obligated to appreciate the misguided vision of a washed up, dare I say even deceased once-hero-of-the-silver-screen-turned-troubador.  With such a forced irony and contrived sense of primal urgency, Lee could never hope to achieve effective expression worthy of the Brian Enos, Frank Zappas and Jack Whites of the past century.</p>

	<p class="article">If the goal of music were to subsume the ego to an extent nearing Galilean, nigh Kubrickian proportions, Bruce Lee would definitely chart somewhere in the middle.  Again, this isn’t high art.</p>

	<p class="article">“I had an idea you’d be snooping around.”  Track 4, titled “My Way of Kung Fu, Pt. 4” kicks off with the arrogant declaration, right out of Mortician’s playbook, may I add, that we are “[H]eaded for the freezer.”  These and other such bloated leaps toward hegemony, while finding Lee flying death-defyingly close to the sun in spite of himself, precede nothing but squalls of over-assertive, dynamically confusing drivel.  Think Nine Inch Nails with, I don’t know, actual lyrical content.</p>

	<p class="article">Oh, and, lest we forget to note that while other films were employing the masterful majesty of maestros Ennio Morricone  or Angelo Baladamenti (who doesn’t love Inland Empire?) , we are left with nothing but the familar Spaghetti Western rumblings of Lee’s delusions of heroic grandeur.  Overall, we acquiesce in all fairness to Lee’s legacy of juxtaposed brutality and grace, and allow this collection of alleged music on its way with a modest 9.3 out of 10.</p>
