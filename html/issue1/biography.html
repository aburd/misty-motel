	<p class="article">It isn't often that peaple use the expression, “That guy is a huge chode.” But consider what is merely a few raindrops in most people's lives a river – nay, an ocean – in the life of Bonerville's own Schmidt McHercules. </p>

	<p class="article">Often referred to by locals as a “champion of boners,” Schmidt grew up on a farm with not much to do other than be a useless piece of shit. From the age of 1, the Bonerville native has been wasting precious oxygen simply by staying alive. Many residents of the county have commented on this over the years.</p>

	<p class="article">Ferbingersburg's own Fanny O'Heartfailure has said, “In my day we didn't have people like Schmidt. We had useful people who didn't spend every day with their head up their own ass! What a fucking turd.” </p>

	<p class="article">Though thirty miles away, many residents of Grundle City have remarked similarly. Pat Mysack was interviewed on the scene just a few days ago, “I have never seen such a buttless ding-dong. Just the other day I saw him walking around like the worthless sack of shit he is.”</p>

	<p class="article">Lest we forget, Bonerville has its share of Schmidt-haters – namely, every resident of Bonerville. We had the chance to talk with the mayor of Bonerville himself, Mr. Throb Binghardon, who had this to say: “Schmidt McHurcules is the kind of guy I'd like to give a mushroom stamp.” </p>

	<p class="article">Rick Beefjeep, 27, of Garfield was totally normal until he watched The Holy Mountain by Alejandro Jodorowsky. He didn’t die but he’s weird now.</p>

	<p class="article">As you can see, when talking about the menace McHercules, people commonly use words like 'inept,' 'valueless,' and 'unproductive.'</p>

	<p class="article">But these people fail to recognize that behind his general incompetence lies more than we might perceive at first glance. On closer inspection, you will find that while, yes, he may seem like just a futile human being, he is also a human being whose face looks like somebody left a heap of spaghetti in a fire for thirty minutes, and his scent can be likened to a bucket of fermenting corpse anuses.</p>
