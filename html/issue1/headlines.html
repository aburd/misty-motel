	<h3>Duggar Family’s Comments On Faith Actually Complex Metaphor For Trust in Biology</h3>
	<p class="article">In a recent interview, Jim Bob Duggar says he wants the world to know they got him all wrong when it comes to religion. “When I said Michelle and I want God to decide how many children we have, I meant we would let nature take its course. It’s just a matter of biological science,” he told reporters on Saturday. The father of 19 children and television star has been unfairly pigeonholed into appearing devoutly Christian due to the lack of context offered by the reality television format, he says.  “Skillful editing makes it seem like there are religious connotations to things I’m saying when you’d know there aren’t if you heard how much cursing I’m doing around all that stuff.” In the same interview, Jim Bob also admitted to being responsible for Michelle’s hair.</p>

	<h3>Man Refusing to Pay for Spotify Premium Hears Fewer Than 2 Commercials Per Hour</h3>
	<p class="article">"Content" is what the world has decided to call every single shred of output from the entire population of journalists, artists, writers, filmmakers, designers, musicians, etc. It is the umbrella under which all creative works fall. Content is a word at once meaningless and insidious. It may seem like mere semantics -- "who cares what we call it?" -- but the word is a cancer in tangible ways.</p>

	<h3>Majority Of Activist’s Timet Spent With Mentally Ill Occurs In Online Video Games</h3>
	<p class="article">The casual music listener doesn’t have sufficient need for Spotify Premium and so they tolerate a commercial or two every quarter hour to hear their favorite jams free of charge. Architectural draftsman Hank Hogan uses the online streaming service nearly 8 hours per day, but manages to hear fewer than 2 commercials per hour on average, and often goes hours at a time hearing none at all. How does he game the system? Hank listens to very long songs throughout the work day, including outtakes from Stooges’ studio time, artsy Andy Warhol interviews where the subject ignores all questions and doesn’t respond, and stock sound clips of the world’s animal population.  “The 6 hour bird songs CD relaxes me in the hectic afternoons when partners are checking on the progress of blueprints incessantly, and Iggy Pop says some insightful things around the 2 hour 19 minute mark of the Cutting Room Floor documentary album.”Scientists have recently released numerous studies indicating that Hank’s style is in line with traditional musical ideas. Doctors at the University of Toronto point out in a recent study that people used to go see whole operas, and now they struggle to wait for the chorus of a Katy Perry song.  Hogan also blames millennials.</p>
