	<h3>Insert Content Here</h3>
	<h4>by Bill Janson</h4>

	<p class="article">I remember when journalism came in various forms, functions, and flavors. There were features -- long and short-form. Profiles, from hard-hitting to puff-pieces and everything in between. There were news briefs and investigative stories and think pieces and soft news items, and yes, press releases and top-ten lists (but no "listicles" -- whatever the fuck those are).</p>

	<p class="article">Of course, all these things not only still exist, but abound. News exists today in a volume that was -- just ten years ago -- unfathomable. But the labels we give to these vastly different pieces of journalism has shrunk all the way down to one word.</p>

	<p class="article">Content</p>

	<p class="article">"Millennials love content." Every 60 seconds, somewhere in America, a VP at a corporate media conglomerate is putting his hands on a rich mahogany conference-room table, scanning the room, looking each of his colleagues in the eye, and saying those words. I sincerely believe that. And I have never wished for a real-life <a href="http://media.giphy.com/media/HYYhSupblcNTq/giphy.gif" target="blank">ED-209</a> more intensely than when I picture the nods of approval around the table as he (almost certainly he) says this, the lights dimming and the first slide of a PowerPoint deck appearing on a projector screen: "Harnessing the Power of Content."</p>

	<p class="article">"Content" is what the world has decided to call every single shred of output from the entire population of journalists, artists, writers, filmmakers, designers, musicians, etc. It is the umbrella under which all creative works fall. Content is a word at once meaningless and insidious. It may seem like mere semantics -- "who cares what we call it?" -- but the word is a cancer in tangible ways.</p>

	<p class="article">The distillation of all creative works into one single word is an attempt to turn said works into commodities. Commodities are goods and services for which there is no qualitative differentiation across a market. No one chooses where to fill up their tank based on the quality of the gasoline -- because it's all the same. Likewise, it doesn't matter what brand of earbud you buy, because you know that shit will be tangled beyond recognition within a week, and then the left one will stop working within two (which won't stop you from suffering through six months of trying to angle the jack perfectly in your iPod so that sweet tinny sound can flood both ears -- and spread <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/generation-deaf-doctors-warn-dangers-ear-buds-n360041" target="blank">premature deafness</a> -- equally). With quality excised, commodity sales are driven solely by price. And so it is with content. At least that's what the suits of the world are insisting. Under this system, a bot-spun article on the "Secret Weight Loss Pill That's Driving Gym-Owners Out of Business!!" is exactly equivalent to a Billy Collins poem. </p>

	<p class="article">It's like if we all agreed that from here on we would only refer to the nutritious life-sustaining substance we eat only by a single word: "food". That way Kobe beef and <a href="http://static8.businessinsider.com/image/4dad9cda49e2aefa2a160000/arbys.jpg" target="blank">Arby's roast beef</a> become indistinguishable. And if they refuse to tell them apart, why should grocery store owners pay more for one or the other? If you're a Kobe beef rancher (?) and suddenly all the world's buyers are telling you the price is now $5.79 and that you must include a small fries and a soda, what are you supposed to think? <a href="http://www.lessingflynn.com/media/cms/Im_thinking_arbys.jpg" target="blank">Arby's</a>, duh. You are supposed to think Arby's. It was a trick question. You are always to be thinking Arby's and don't fucking forget it.</p>

	<p class="article">The word content takes the power from the authors of creative works ("content creators") and shifts it to the companies that distribute those works. These companies are generally very, very large with their fingers in a lot of pies (and often very different pies like Shepard's and Peach). They needed an easy way to refer to all these disparate creative threads with one blanket phrase and thus the bastard "content" was born.</p>

	<p class="article">But the word itself is a bogeyman. The price for journalism is dirt cheap not because we stopped calling it journalism, but because we won't pay for it. Actually, we never paid for it. But advertisers did. And now we don't need those ads. So The News, in its scramble to replace advertising revenue, replaced itself instead. Sponsored content is the new content. It cuts out the middle man. We can be sold a lawnmower with the highest safety features while reading about a grisly accident the next town over.</p>

	<p class="article">Traditional journalism's stodgy ethics now seem comically out-of-date. Research, sourcing, attribution, follow-up, objectivity -- these are shackles in an age of Buzzfeed. Hell, they were shackles in the age of Drudge.</p>

	<p class="article">It's not the new brash outlets, or the Internet, or the quality of reporting that is ultimately to blame, however. It is us.</p>

	<p class="article">We really do love our content. That addiction is milked and sold to the highest bidders to cover the cost of more content, which we cannot resist, and our eyeballs are again exploited, our brains hacked, minds controlled. We are raised by commercial breaks. By billboards and Station IDs. Sponsorships and contracts. Lawn signs, vending machines, corporate mascots, spokespeople, hosts. Interest groups and political campaigns. TV networks and movie studios and <strike>record companies</strike> Bandcamp pages. #Trending topics. Every single person or <strike>corporate entity</strike> (Ed. Note: redundant) who can pay an awful lot to say very little to an enormous audience.</p>

	<p class="article">Basically, anyone holding a microphone and a fistful of dollars.</p>

	<p class="article">That is what we're up against. Those are our parents, mythologically speaking.</p>

	<p class="article">And journalists were supposed to defend us. At least we like to pretend they were. Journalism has always ridden on the backs of advertisers, but now it's lost the reigns. Maybe it never had them.</p>

	<p class="article">So what is left to defend against the giants that guzzle us like gasoline? Comedy? It's no secret that the most trustworthy source for news has been manning the 11 pm shift on Comedy Central for the better part of the last two decades. Lately that cowl has passed to Jon Oliver, notably on a network that eschews advertising dollars in favor of directly asking for our pocket change. Comedy is only as valuable as it is honest, which has become less and less true of journalism.</p>

	<p class="article">But comedy can only do so much. It is always searching for the next laugh. Morality and truth will never be the primary goals, but they can be worthy secondary ones.</p>

	<p class="article">We might have to settle for that.</p>
